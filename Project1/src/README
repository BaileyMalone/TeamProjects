Known Problems:
- This version does provide a group match that may not necessarily be the best match.  
- This version runs through its sequence once with a maximum complexity of O(n^2) to 
  create teams by comparing every user to every other user one time.
- We did not account for preferred groups in this version, any data containing preferred 
  group information will break this application.
